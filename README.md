## About

This project is a web application designed to digitize the internship search process by gathering all internship offers and recording information about companies that have hosted interns or are currently seeking one. The goal is to streamline the connection between students looking for internships and companies offering opportunities.

This project was undertaken during my second year of preparatory classes, equivalent to the second year of undergraduate studies (Bac+2) in the French education system as part of a school assignment, providing valuable hands-on experience in software development and teamwork.
